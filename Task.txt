Requirements
1. Server should be able to retrieve a “POST” request to “/search” endpoint. 
2. “/search” endpoint should require 2 parameters - “size” (Number) and “searchText”. Number parameter represents the number of entities that should be read from api and saved to database. SearchText - string to filter the data.
3. The response from “/search” endpoint should be a list with data retrieved form API. Same dataset should be stored in elasticsearch.
4. You can use “Books API”, “NY Times Article API” or any you want.
5. Implement other endpoints for editing and deleting entities. 

pass from “Books API”, “NY Times Article API”:
